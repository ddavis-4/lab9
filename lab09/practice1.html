    My name is Dylan Davis. I am a second year, persuing a bachelors of Computer Science from the University of Kansas. <br>
    I enjoy an active lifestyle, playing tennis and basketball or working out, as often as I can; <br>
    However, when I am not being active you can find me reading, writing or hanging out with friends. <br>
    I also love playing chess here is my favorite chess match played between Hikaru Nakamura and Wesley So in 2015.<br>
